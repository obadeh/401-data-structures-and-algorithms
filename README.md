and methods.
## Challenge Description

Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
Define a method called isEmpty that does not take an argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
